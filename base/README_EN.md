# 1. Main ideas

The proposed concepts are aimed at rapid development of application software for controllers ICS, taking into account the maximum number of standard requirements for functionality and possible integration with other subsystems.

The framework provides:

- use of uniform principles of software development for programmable controllers IEC 61131 (and not only) for different types of objects of medium (about \> 100 channels) and high channel and algorithmic complexity;

- the use of common approaches to the organization of the management hierarchy;

- agreed set of data types, classes of functions/functional blocks for any objects;

The framework can be implemented in any hardware and software and programming languages that have the ability and resources to implement it. The proposed interfaces and structures can be changed and supplemented if necessary without violating the general ideology.
